keras -- package to build neural network..

Keras.model.sequential class is a wrapper for the neural network model that treats the network as a sequence of layers. It implements 
keras model interface with common method like compile(), fit(), and evaluate() that are used to train and run the model.

from keras.models import Sequential
#creating a sequential model
model = Sequential()

The keras layer provides a common interface for a variety of standard neuaral network layers. there are fully connected layers,
max pool layers, activation layers and more. To add layer to a model use add() method.
