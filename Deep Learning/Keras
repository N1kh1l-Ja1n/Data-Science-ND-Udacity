keras -- package to build neural network..

Keras.model.sequential class is a wrapper for the neural network model that treats the network as a sequence of layers. It implements 
keras model interface with common method like compile(), fit(), and evaluate() that are used to train and run the model.

from keras.models import Sequential
#creating a sequential model
model = Sequential()

The keras layer provides a common interface for a variety of standard neuaral network layers. there are fully connected layers,
max pool layers, activation layers and more. To add layer to a model use add() method.

{
#model with simple hidden layer
import numpy as np
from keras.models import sequential
from keras.layers.core import Dense, Activation

#X - input training data
X = np.array([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]], dtype = np.float32)

#y - output vector for each input vector
y = n.array([[0],[0],[0],[1]], dtype = np.float32)

#creating the sequential model
model = Sequential()

#adding input layer of 32 nodes with the same imput shape as training samples in x
model.add(Dense(32, input_dim = X.shape[1]))

#adding a softmax activation layer
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

#adding a fully connected output layer 
model.add(Dense(1))

#adding a sigmoid activation layer
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
