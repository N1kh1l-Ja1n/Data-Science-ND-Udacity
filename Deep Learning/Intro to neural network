The first thing which comes to mind when I think about neural networks is perceptron. What is perceptron?
Perceptron is a linear classifier and it helps to classify the given input data. Perceptron is a single layer NN. 
It consists of four parts:
 - input values or one input layer
 - Weights and Sum
 - Net Sum
 - Activation function
