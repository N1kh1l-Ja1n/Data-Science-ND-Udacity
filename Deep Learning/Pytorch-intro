Pytorch -- Build a deep neural network using pytorch. Tensors are the main data structure of pytorch. 
Autograd is a module which pytorch uses to calculate gradients for training neural networks. 
pytorch tensors are just like numpy arrays

Tensors
It turns out neural network computations are just a bunch of linear algebra 
operations on tensors, a generalization of matrices. A vector is a 1-dimensional tensor,
a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor, an array with three indices is a 3-dimensional tensor (RGB color images for example). 
The fundamental data structure for neural networks are tensors and PyTorch (as well as pretty much every other deep learning 
framework) is built around tensors.
